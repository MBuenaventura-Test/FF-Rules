### 1. Submissions
1.1 Questions must be submitted prior to the start of the Grand Prix.
1.2 Changes to picks can be made as often as desired until the race starts.

### 2. Scoring Format
2.1 Every weekend the first three (3) questions will be your podium picks for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place. (Example #1)
   - Fifteen (15) points are awarded for correctly selecting the driver in 1st place.
   - Ten (10) points are awarded for correctly selecting the driver in 2nd place.
   - Ten (10) points are awarded for correctly selecting the driver in 3rd place.

> **Example #1**
> Drivers Selected:
> - P1. Max Verstappen
> - P2. Lewis Hamilton
> - P3. Charles Leclerc
> Race Results:
> - P1. Max Verstappen (+15 Points)
> - P2. Sergio Perez (0 Points)
> - P3. Lewis Hamilton (+5 Points)
>
> Based on the race results, you have scored a total of twenty (20) combined points. Fifteen (15) points were awarded for correctly selecting Max Verstappen as the race winner, and five (5) points for guessing Lewis Hamilton, but not having the correct position. Zero (0) points were awarded for not selecting Sergio Perez to finish P2 or any podium position.

2.2 Five (5) points are awarded for each driver you selected for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, but not in the correct finishing position. 
   - Selecting the same driver for more than one podium position will only count once for points. (Example #2)

> **Example #2**
> Drivers Selected:
> - P1. Max Verstappen
> - P2. Max Verstappen
> - P3. Max Verstappen
> Race Results:
> - P1. Max Verstappen (+15 Points)
> - P2. Sergio Perez (0 Points)
> - P3. Lewis Hamilton (0 Points)
>
> Based on the race results, you have scored a total of fifteen (15) points for correctly selecting Max Verstappen as the race winner. Since Max Verstappen was selected for more than one (1) podium position, no other points are awarded for P2 and P3.
