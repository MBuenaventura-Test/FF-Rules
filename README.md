# 1) Driver Picks

Players will choose a driver from each group, determined by their qualifying position. The best overall pick will receive a total of five (5) points. After the race, each driver within their respective group will be ranked against all other drivers in the same group. One (1) point will be deducted for each position lost according to the final position within that specific group. You cannot incur negative points.

## Groups Format 
- Group A: P1 – P5
- Group B: P6 – P10
- Group C: P11 – P20

## Example (Group A):
| Driver          | Qualifying Position | Race Result | Group Points Results |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Charles Leclerc | P1                  | P7          | 3                    |
| Sergio Perez    | P2                  | P2          | 4                    |
| Max Verstappen  | P3                  | P1          | 5                    |
| Carlos Sainz    | P4                  | P10         | 2                    |
| Lewis Hamilton  | P5                  | P8          | 1                    |

- If your choice was Charles Leclerc, who qualified in P1 but ultimately finished in P7, you would still accumulate a total of three (3) points. This is because each driver is evaluated solely within its group, based on the group's race results, Charles Leclerc finished in 3rd place for Group 1.
- Selecting Max Verstappen, who qualified in P3 but finished in P1, would earn you a net total of five (5) points, given that he secured the top position in that group.
- Drivers concluding the race in positions P16 to P20 will result in zero (0) points as you cannot incur negative points.
