## Submissions

1. Questions must be submitted before the race starts for that Grand Prix.

### Changes to Picks
2. Changes to picks can be made as often as desired until the race starts.

## Scoring Format

### Podium Picks

#### 1st Place
- 15 points are awarded for correctly selecting the driver in 1st place.

#### 2nd Place
- 10 points are awarded for correctly selecting the driver in 2nd place.

#### 3rd Place
- 10 points are awarded for correctly selecting the driver in 3rd place.

### Scoring Points

#### Correct Selections
- 5 points are awarded for each driver selected for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd but not in the correct finishing position.

#### Incorrect Positions
- Selecting the same driver for more than one podium position will only count once for points.

### Example #1
**Drivers Selected:**
- P1. Max Verstappen
- P2. Lewis Hamilton
- P3. Charles Leclerc

**Race Results:**
- P1. Max Verstappen (+15 Points)
- P2. Sergio Perez (0 Points)
- P3. Lewis Hamilton (+5 Points)

Based on the race results, you have scored a total of 20 combined points. 15 points were awarded for correctly selecting Max Verstappen as the race winner, and 5 points for guessing Lewis Hamilton, but not having the correct position. 0 points were awarded for not selecting Sergio Perez to finish P2 or any podium position.

### Example #2
**Drivers Selected:**
- P1. Max Verstappen
- P2. Max Verstappen
- P3. Max Verstappen

**Race Results:**
- P1. Max Verstappen (+15 Points)
- P2. Sergio Perez (0 Points)
- P3. Lewis Hamilton (0 Points)

Based on the race results, you have scored a total of 15 points for correctly selecting Max Verstappen as the race winner. Since Max Verstappen was selected for more than one (1) podium position, no other points are awarded for P2 and P3.
